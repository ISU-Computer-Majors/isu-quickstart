The ISU Computer Majors Quick Start Guide
=========================================

This guide was created to help Computer Majors (If you are a humanites major you are prabably lost) get stated with some of the basic skill needed for computer programming and using the computers at ISU.

Getting Started
---------------

This guide will try to assume as little as possible about your previous experience. If you use Linux or ios use the shell. If you use Windows I recommend Cygwin. First you will need to check if git is installed on your machine.

    git --version

If it is not go to git-scm.com and install it. Next this repo needs to be cloned. Navigate (cd) to the directory you want this project to reside and run:

    git clone git@github.com:ISU-Computer-Majors/isu-quickstart.git

then run:

    cd isu-quickstart
    ./getting_started.sh

You can then follow the prompts.

Contributing
------------

Humanities major jokes
----------------------

What do you say when you find a liberal-arts major on your porch?
Answer: How much do I owe you for the pizza?
